Just copy the script `gc-bak.sh` to your home directory and make it\r\nexecutable.\r\n\r\n`$ chmod +x gc-bak.sh`\r\n\r\nThat's all it takes to get ready for a backup.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nEveryone working with electronic media should be aware of data protection.\r\nIt happens all over the time that data are irretrievably lost due to hardware faults,\r\nsystem errors or user errors (the most common type).\r\nThrough a regular backup the total loss of data can be prevented.\r\nIn particular, facing profound changes to the system, such as partitioning, a backup is a must.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n -  **Full Backup**: Backup of the entire dataset.\r\n -  **Differential Backup**: Contains all the changes that have occurred since the last full backup.\r\n -  **Incremental Backup**: Contains all the changes that were made since the last backup\r\n    (full backup or incremental backup).\r\n -  **Images**: Backup of complete partitions or disks\r\n -  **RAID**: RAID array of two or more hard drives in which all data is stored several times\r\n    (redundant) and one is protected against failure of one or more individual drives.\r\n    There are different RAID levels, of which only RAID 0 is inappropriate.\r\n\r\n    **Warning: RAID is no substitute for a data backup!**\r\n\r\n### Strategies\r\n\r\nThe following questions should be asked by everyone who is concerned with the security of his data:\r\n\r\n -  What data should I back up and where do I find it?\r\n -  How often should a backup be performed?\r\n -  Where should I store the backup?\r\n -  Where should I deposit the backup media?\r\n\r\n## Backup with GreenCape Backup\r\n\r\n**GreenCape Backup** is made to make backups easy. It is able to backup a complete system, so it\r\ncan be restored on a fresh install. Internally, it uses `apt` to handle the installed packages,\r\npackage sources, and trusted keys.\r\n\r\n### Operation mode\r\n\r\nThe operation modes *backup* or *restore* are invoked using the `-b|--backup` or `-r|--restore`\r\nswitches respectively. `--backup` is the default operation mode.\r\n\r\n### Packages\r\n\r\n**GreenCape Backup** creates a list of all installed packages, their states, corresponding\r\nsources and trusted keys. This information is used during a restore to re-install those packages.\r\n\r\n### System files\r\n\r\nAs per default, **GreenCape Backup** includes all system files, i.e., the content of the\r\ndirectories `/etc`, `/opt`, `/usr/local`, `/var/games`, `/var/lib`, `/var/local`, `/var/mail`,\r\n`/var/opt`, and `/var/www`. The inclusion of the system files can be suppressed by using the\r\n`-n|--no-system` option.\r\n\r\nThe system directories may contain cache data or local backups. The inclusion of these files\r\ncan be suppressed using the `-c|--clean` option.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nBackup packages and system files without cache data and local backup files:\r\n\r\n`$ sudo ./gc-bak.sh --backup --clean`\r\n\r\nRestore on a new install:\r\n\r\n`$ sudo ./gc-bak.sh --restore`\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\n## Versioning\r\n\r\nFor transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backwards\r\ncompatibility, **GreenCape Backup** will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines\r\nas much as possible.\r\n\r\nReleases will be numbered with the follow format:\r\n\r\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\r\n\r\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major\r\n* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor\r\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch\r\n\r\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Tracker\r\n\r\nHave a bug?
