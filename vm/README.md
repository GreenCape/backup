Testing your Backup
===================

    You should always have in mind, that you want to restore your data in case of data loss,
    and not just want to have a backup, that cannot be restored.

Virtual Machine
---------------

Create or download a virtual machine corresponding to your setup, for example, Ubuntu 12.04.
You can find ready-to-run images for VirtualBox at

    http://virtualboxes.org/images/

Download the package and unpack it.
