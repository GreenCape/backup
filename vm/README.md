Testing your Backup
===================

    You should always have in mind, that you want to restore your data in case of data loss,
    and not just want to have a backup, that cannot be restored.

Virtual Machine
---------------

Create or download a virtual machine corresponding to your setup, for example, Ubuntu 12.04.
A very comprehensive tutorial for the installation and setup of a virtual box is found at
